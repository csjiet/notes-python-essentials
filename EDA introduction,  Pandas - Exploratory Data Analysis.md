# Exploratory Data Analysis
- The critical process of performing **initial investigations** on data so as to **discover patterns**, to **spot anomalies**, to **test hypothesis** and to **check assumptions** with the help of **summary statistics** and **graphical representations**.

# Phases of data exploration
(These procedures pendulum back and forth to gauge better understanding of the data, although it starts sequentially)
- Data understanding
- Data preparation
- Feature Understanding


# [[Pandas Data Frames]]
In order to be liberated from memorization, lets ask ourselves:
Questions that are answered in [[Pandas Data Frames]]:
1. What is a data frame?
2. How are data frames stored in a computer?
3. How are data frames different from normal matrix arrays? 

# Phases of EDA: Top to bottom process of data analytics.

## Phase: IMPORTS 
- [[EDA 0 > IMPORTS]]

## Phase: DATA UNDERSTANDING
- [[EDA 1 > DATA UNDERSTANDING]]

## Phase: DATA PREPARATION
- [[EDA 2 > DATA PREPARATION]]

## Phase: Feature Understanding
- [[EDA 3 > FEATURE UNDERSTANDING]]

## Phase: Feature Relationships 
- [[EDA 4 > FEATURE RELATIONSHIP]]

## Generic data frame operations
- Functions:
	- `df= df.copy()`
		- Shallow copies the referenced dataframe, so it creates a new mem location for the copied data frame.

Jargon:
- **Series**: "a series" in Pandas data frame, refers to a column in a table/ a 1D array holding data of any type.
